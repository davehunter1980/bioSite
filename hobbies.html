            Bob has, been gaming since the early 90's. Among his favorite games are the <i>Diablo</i> series, <i>Final Fantasy</i> and the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> series. Before joining the Marine Corp, he was in school to become a game developer. This was where we met, even joining a game development club together.

        <p>During the Covid lockdown, he took up woodworking as a way to pass time when he wasn't working. These are some images his Kari took of him working on a project. He also does some wood lathing but he claims he's not very good at it.</p>
